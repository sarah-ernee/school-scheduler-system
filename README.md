# school-scheduler-system

Built with Vue3 and Vite. Planned to use [vue-full-calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-full-calendar) but ran into dependency issues. Could not try out transformation of data from parent component, scheduleSlots to create weekly event in child component.

Designed as an SPA where SettingsForm as the parent component and ScheduleTable as the child component.

If given more time, would iron things out like:

1. Validation of number of slots against input in booking sessions
2. Refine addition and removal of time slots
3. UI responsiveness in different screen sizes
4. Dependency issue with vue-full-calendar
